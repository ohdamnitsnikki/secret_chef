  ## What does the app do?
* As a user just visiting the page you are able to read other users blog posts and comments and also view the amount of likes a post have. But as a logged in user you are able to:
   * Use a form to send your own recipes for approval to the admin.
   * Comment on the posts and by that being able to conversate with other users.
   * Like and unlike posts.

## Consistent styling

## Features


## Features Left to Implement

1. On home page I would prefer it to be moving pictures of kids, like gifs or shorter movies. Maybe an audio of some baby laughter.

2. There should be pictures or videos to all cards with shown content on how to do the specific tip. For example on tips and tricks there is one card telling you to button the body over the babies shoulder to make them stay still. It would be more informative with a video showing the tip. Or on the card that mentions white noises it could be a playlist to use.

3. On the banner image for desktop, the train could be pulling the cover text on screen instead of having it pop when the train have passed.

## Testing

1. My page with its animations and cards appear good on desktop (1201px and up) and also on smaller screens (1200px and below). 

2. Page works good on chrome, firefox, iphone and android. On explorer the pictures in the index file has another width and also the train isn't appearing.

3. All links are tested in each try of diffrent browsers and all opens in a new window.

### Validator Testing

Url for new parent is tested in both [W3C-validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C-CSS-validaor](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=sv&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Fohdamnitsnikki.github.io%2Fnew-parent%2F&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1)

### Deployment 

**_New Parent_** is deployed to GitHub pages, this was the steps:
* Through the GitHub repository go to settings
* Click on pages and use the branch menu to choose "main"
* Refresh the page and a link to the final project will be deployed

Live link here - [New Parent](https://ohdamnitsnikki.github.io/new-parent/)

* On the main site there is a fork button to create your own repository without affecting the orginal project or you could go into the project file and use the code button and clone the project directly.

## Credits

1. The template is taken from [Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
2. For help during these projects I've used my mentor, the tutors and the I think therfore I blog walkthrough project.
3. The form for registration, sign in and sign out is completely built with djangos premade forms. Also the blog posts html code is from the walkthrough project. I've just added in some colours to make it fit my page since the content already looked so good. That also goes for the comment content and comment form. 
4. To get inspired about box-shadows and subsribe button I've used [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/)
5. To understand how to style img in readme file I've used code from [SeanCDavid](https://www.seancdavis.com/posts/three-ways-to-add-image-to-github-readme/)
